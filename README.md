BUS
===

Experiments in consensus-based storage in Rust. Don't take it too seriously.

This is will probably require nightly for a good long while.

Plan
----

 1. Make a hardened abstract raft implementation in bus-raft.
 2. Hook it up to an actual network via a real transport implementation (using actix?).
 3. ... do cool stuff
